Trirand Inc offers the exporting web service free of charge. If you include the
exporting module in your charts, two buttons will appear in the upper right. 
One button prints the chart, which is done on the client side only. The other
button handles exporting. By default, an SVG representation of the chart is 
sent by POST to http://trirand/jqcharts/, where it is converted using Apache's
Batik converter to PDF, PNG or JPEG. 

SERVER SETUP
============

If you want to set up this web service on your own server, the index.php file
that handles the POST is supplied in the download package inside the 
php/jqchart-export directory.

1. Make sure that PHP and Java is installed on your server.
2. Upload the index.php file from the php/jqchart-export directory in the download package to your server.
3. In your FTP program, create directory called temp in the same directory as index.php and chmod this new directory to 777 (Linux/Unix servers only).
4. Download Batik from http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/#download. Find the binary distribution for your version of JRE
5. Upload batik-rasterizer.jar and the entire lib directory to a location where the index.php is (or some other).
6. In the options in the top of the index.php file, set the path to batik-rasterier.jar (in case the jar files are copied in another dir).
7. In your chart options using setExporting method, set the url option to match your PHP file location.
